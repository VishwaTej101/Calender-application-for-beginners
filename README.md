Aim:To create a Calender Application with DatePicker.

Approch:
Here we have taken an DatePicker widget in xml file and aligned it with releative layout.
we have called the predefined calendar value and made the design.

we have also used toast widget for showing the year month and date.

Note:
Here we have not used the CalenderView which is provided in palette->legacy tab
Here we have to go first along with year, month and date. 

 other wise if we call in any other sequence we might not get the desired outcome.
